\chapter{Conclusion \& Future Work}
\label{cha:conclusion}
\section{Key Contributions}
\label{sec:key contributions}
• MFE/DNN Code - Full C implementation for Simulation in reproducing the behavior (the model is not quantized, so the behavior is ideal)\newline 
• Speaker Verification Distillated\newline 
• Quantization - Systematic approach to 8-bit quantization, not 4-bit (too experimental)\newline 

\section{Future Directions}
\label{sec:future directions}
• If able to access to Syntiant, can deploy a compatible binary SV model\newline 
• Integration with existing system, that according to my system response will act as consequence\newline
• Adaptive Training (The code is ready, but can't be tested properly)\newline
